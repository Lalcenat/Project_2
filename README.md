# GDP
The Effects of GDP on a country's Life Expectancy


Proposal:
The premise of our project is to search for relationships between the life expectancy of a country and its GDP over time. Ideally, we believe that as a country gets “wealthier” the quality of life and therefore the life expectancy increases.

Data Extraction Sources:
•	CSV from Kaggle where we get every country’s GDP over a span of a certain time period
•	CSV from World Bank database where we get every country’s Life Expectancy over several years.

Data Transformation:
•	We will load CSVs to pandas to be read and transformed into data frames.
•	We will clean the data frames, rename, and drop the data that we do not need using pandas.
•	Load clean data into SQL using pandas.
•	Plot some data frames to find relationships

Conclusion and Summarization:
•	We will use HTML and CSS to upload our data and a summary of our processes for presentation use.
